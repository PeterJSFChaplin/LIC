# LIC (Layered Image Controller)
LIC is a template for displaying multiple images layered on top of each other, with controls to hide/show individual layers, using an HTML file. An example of use would be a simple dress-up game.

It requires a modern web browser to run, and images must be in a web-compatible format (png and jpg seem to work OK). You will also need to edit the config file, using a text editor such as Notepad.

(Yes, that means "writing code", but if you have a look at "config.jsonp" it should hopefully be fairly self-explanatory. "Tools to make the config easier to work with" is on the project to-do list).

Sample images and a sample config file are included to demonstrate how it works.

To use:

1. Download it (click the "Dowload ZIP" button, then extract the zip file)
2. Replace the contents of the "images" folder with your own images
3. Edit the "config.jsonp" file to describe how your images are layered and positioned

I do plan to add more features and documentation in future, on a when-I-get-around-to-it basis.

Any questions, please drop me an email.
